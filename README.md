# node-livecode

This is a node.js module that provides livecoding support. In response
to websocket commands, it loads additional npm modules at runtime,
evaluates free-standing JavaScript code, and adds new protocol
instructions for other clients to use. This is part of the Caffeine
project.

Thanks to Chris Tomich for his help!
